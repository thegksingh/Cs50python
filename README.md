# CS50Python — My Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my solutions and projects from [Harvard’s CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/).  

I have completed all the course lectures, problem sets, and my final project. Alongside the official assignments, I am also including personal projects and practice exercises that I built while exploring Python.

- **ps0, ps1, …** — Solutions to CS50P problem sets  
- **mini projects** — Small personal projects and experiments  
- **Fun exercise** — Practice code and exploratory work  

The repository will continue to grow as I explore neew python projects and exercises.

## Current Status

- Lectures: Completed  
- Problem Sets: Completed  
- Side Projects: Added periodically 
- Final projects: Completed

## Final Project — [Timbre](https://github.com/thegksingh/Timbre)

My CS50P final project is maintained in a separate repository called **Timbre**.  

Timbre explores:  
- Speech-to-speech conversion  
- Text-to-speech synthesis  
- Grammar improvements  
- Support for multiple languages and accents  
- Expressive voice styles (e.g., storytelling, conversational, robotic)  

This project combines the knowledge gained from CS50P with additional experimentation in speech technologies.

## Motivation

I do not come from a traditional computer science background. My motivation for taking CS50P was to build a strong foundation in programming and to create projects that feel practical and impactful.  

This repository is not only a collection of solutions but also a record of my learning process — including progress, challenges, and growth as a programmer.

## How to Run

To try out the code locally:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/thegksingh/Cs50python.git
---

```bash
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
# Navigate into the folder
cd Cs50python
```

```bash
# Run a Python file (example)
python ps0/esistein.py
---

Requirements

Python 3.10 or later is recommended

Some projects may use external libraries (a requirements.txt file will be added if necessary)

Closing Notes

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly. My aim is not only to complete CS50P but also to document a clear, structured learning journey in Python.

Check out my final project Timbre for an example of how I combined CS50P skills into a practical application.

Feel free to explore, ask questions, and contribute!
