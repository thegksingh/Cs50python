# choosen a variable what whicn take input and if input if any one from add,subtract,divide or multiply it's run accordingly
# firts its ask if value or variable is add,if yes then its run add run code
# if its not add then it check for subtract, if yes then it run subtract code
# if it not add or subtract it check for divde,if yes then it run divide code
# if its not anyone above three then it check for multiply, if yes it run multiply code
# and for some odd reason user decide not type anything esle then any four of these,it will print invalid input
